            <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm a senior Software Engineering student at Miami University (OH). I'm pursuing a degree in Software Engineering with a minor in Humanitarian Engineering & Computing.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about people and how technology can transform our lives. This past summer I worked for Target in Minneapolis where I created a web application in conjunction with 
          my team's mobile apps to provide analytics on the app's usage. In the past I worked at Miami University where I oversaw the College of Engineering & Computing's website. 
        I kept information up-to-date and designed new layouts to keep viewers interested. 
        <p>I'm involved in Alpha Phi Omega (service fraternity), Girls Who Code,
        the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute, and am the co-founder/president of Miami's ACM-W (Association for Computing Machinery - Women) chapter.
        I spend most of my free time making music, painting, and tweeting. I'm also a big fan of dogs. And robots. And robot dogs.</p></div>
