    <p >This project began as a class assignment for a course on Globalization and Human Rights.
      The goal: raising money and awarenss for Syrian refugees. The team began thinking about 
      how we could do this. We came up with numerous fundraising ideas: asking resteraunts in the
      area to donate a portion of their profits to the cause, asking for individual donations by 
      emailing classmates, and asking friends and family. But we realized the awareness factor is 
      just as important. Do people really know what these refugees experience? We decided to set up 
      tables in our school's student center that will give students the opportunity to try and experience
      what refugees do. Through that and this website, we feel we're not only asking people for money,
      but asking them to learn and understand. It's through education and understanding that we can generate 
      meaningful change.
